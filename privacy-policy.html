            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="section-intro">Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data.</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We collect personal information ("Personal Data") that you provide when you register for an account, purchase a certification, or contact us through our website. This information includes your name, email address, shipping address, and pet information such as your dog's name and photo.</p>

            <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
            <p>We use your Personal Data to fulfill your order and ship your diploma, manage your account and license status, and publicly display your pet's name, photo, and license status as part of the official public registry. Your information helps us provide you with the best possible service and maintain an accurate database of certified therapy dogs.</p>

            <h3>3. Payment Processing</h3>
            <p>We do not store or process your sensitive payment information such as credit card numbers. All transactions are processed externally through Stripe, which adheres to its own stringent security standards and PCI compliance requirements. Your financial information is handled securely and never touches our servers.</p>

            <h3>4. Public Disclosure and Your Pet's Data</h3>
            <p>By purchasing a certification and uploading your dog's photo, you grant the Association a perpetual license to use, display, and distribute your pet's name and photo publicly on the website. This includes the "Verify a License" page and the "Gallery" page as part of the public registry. This public display is a core feature of the certification service.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h3>6. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your rights regarding your personal data, please contact us via our Contact page. We will respond to your inquiry within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
