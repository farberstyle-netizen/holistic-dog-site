            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p class="section-intro">By accessing this website and purchasing a certification, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>

            <h3>1. The Certification (Official Disclaimer)</h3>
            <p>The Holistic Therapy Dog certification is a commemorative title only. It is not a Service Animal certification under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or any other local, state, or federal law. It confers no special rights, privileges, or access to public spaces. You agree not to misrepresent this title as a legal certification for any purpose.</p>

            <h3>2. User Conduct</h3>
            <p>You agree to use the website lawfully and warrant that all information you provide is true and accurate, that your dog has no history of aggression toward people or other animals, and that you will not misrepresent your dog's commemorative title as conferring any legal status or public access rights.</p>

            <h3>3. User-Generated Content</h3>
            <p>By submitting your dog's photo and name, you grant the Association a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display this content on the website's public registry. This includes the Gallery page and the Verify License page where your dog's certification status can be publicly confirmed.</p>

            <h3>4. Payment and Fees</h3>
            <p>All certification fees are processed via Stripe. The current fee is valid for a two-year certification period, after which a renewal fee is required to keep the license active in the public registry. Failure to renew will result in the removal of the listing from the public registry and deactivation of the license.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>The Association shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of or inability to use the service. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the certification.</p>

            <h3>6. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these terms shall be resolved in the courts of New York County.</p>
