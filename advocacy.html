            <h2>Understanding Your Rights</h2>
            <p>The landscape of assistance animal law is complex and evolving. While Holistic Therapy Dogs do not automatically grant the same public access rights as Service Animals under the Americans with Disabilities Act, they serve as vital components of mental health and emotional wellness strategies for millions of Americans.</p>
            
            <p>The HTDA is committed to educating our community about the current legal framework while advocating for expanded recognition of the therapeutic value these animals provide.</p>

            <div class="callout-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> The Holistic Therapy Dog certification is commemorative and does not confer legal rights under the ADA. It is not a substitute for a Service Animal certification or an Emotional Support Animal letter from a licensed mental health professional.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>Legal Framework Overview</h2>
            
            <h3>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h3>
            <p>The ADA defines a Service Animal as a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability. The task the dog performs must be directly related to the person's disability. Under federal law, Service Animals are permitted in all public places where their handlers are allowed to go.</p>
            <p>Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) and Therapy Dogs are not covered under the ADA's public access provisions. This is an area where the HTDA advocates for thoughtful policy reform based on demonstrated behavior and handler responsibility.</p>
            
            <h3>Fair Housing Act (FHA)</h3>
            <p>The Fair Housing Act provides broader protections for assistance animals in housing. Under the FHA, landlords and housing providers must make reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities who require an assistance animal—including emotional support animals—even in properties with "no pets" policies.</p>
            <p>To qualify for this accommodation, individuals typically need documentation from a licensed healthcare provider establishing their disability-related need for the animal. The HTDA certification does not replace this documentation but can serve as supplemental evidence of the animal's temperament and therapeutic role.</p>
            
            <h3>Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA)</h3>
            <p>In 2021, the U.S. Department of Transportation revised its rules under the ACAA, narrowing the definition of service animals on aircraft to only trained psychiatric service dogs. Emotional Support Animals are no longer guaranteed free cabin access on commercial flights.</p>
            <p>The HTDA is actively monitoring legislative proposals that would create pathways for well-behaved therapy animals with documented flight experience to travel with their handlers. We advocate for a "Good Citizen" exception that recognizes dogs with proven records of calm behavior in transit environments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2>Our Advocacy Mission</h2>
            <p>The Holistic Therapy Dog Association believes that the current legal framework does not fully recognize the profound therapeutic benefits that dogs provide to individuals dealing with stress, anxiety, depression, and other challenges.</p>
            
            <p>We advocate for:</p>
            <ul style="line-height: 2; color: #555; margin-left: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Recognition of behavioral certification standards for therapy animals</li>
                <li>Expanded housing protections for certified therapy dog handlers</li>
                <li>Pilot programs allowing certified therapy dogs in select public spaces</li>
                <li>Research funding to document the measurable health benefits of canine companionship</li>
                <li>Education for property managers, airlines, and businesses on the distinction between service animals, ESAs, and therapy dogs</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
